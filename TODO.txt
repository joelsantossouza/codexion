DONT FORGET TO ADAPT THE CHANGES ON MAKEFILE

- Move the spend_time to the coder_routine_utils.c (make more sense)
- Maybe turn all manipulations into a utils directory (MAYBE)
- Put the get_coder_rules and get_monitor_rules under its respective files_utils.c
- Improve separate responsability on schedulers
	- schedulers reclaim all released dongles and then return the priority coder
