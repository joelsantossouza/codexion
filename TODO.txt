DONT FORGET TO ADAPT THE CHANGES ON MAKEFILE

- COMPILATIONS_HISTORY MUST NOT BE A QUEUE
- THE ORDER OF MONITOR WILL BE:
	- GET PRIORITY CODER (EDF OR FIFO)
		- EDF STORES A QUEUE INSIDE IT THAT REPRESENTS THE DEADLINES
		OR INITIALIZE AN ARRAY WITH ONE BY ONE EARLIEST DEADLINES,
		THEN THEN ARRAY WILL JUST BE ITERATE CIRCULARLY INTO THE ARRAY
		ONCE IT WILL COMPILE AS PRIORITY ONE BY ONE
		
		- FIFO WILL STATICALLY RETURN ONE BY ONE ON CODER ARRAY ORDER
		AS PRIORITY

	- WHILE DOES NOT HAVE 2 AVAILABLE DONGLES, LOOP THROUGH EVERY
	CODER TO GET RELEASED DONGLES

	- PUT TWO DONGLES ON PRIORITY CODER AND REMOVE IT FROM AVAILABLES
